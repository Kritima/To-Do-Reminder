## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

Create a native application for iPhone or iPad (or Universal) that allows the user to schedule and be reminded of his/her tasks. Your application should allow users to add a task with a description as a goal along with the number of days needed to complete the task. Tasks should be added in a table and the user should be able to edit the tasks as well. You are supposed to categorize your tasks as well.
